        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>We're <strong>families from Columbia County and the Taconic Hills School District</strong>.</p>

        <p>We're burdened by high electricity costs. We're worried about the environment our children will inherit. And we're frustrated.</p>

        <p>Frustrated by partisan, agenda-driven NIMBY actors who spread fear about solar energy—not because they care about the environment, but because they're worried about their property values.</p>

        <div class="card mt-8 mb-8" style="background: var(--primary-light); border: 2px solid var(--primary);">
          <h3 style="color: var(--primary-dark);">We are not:</h3>
          <ul style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">
            <li>Funded by any solar company</li>
            <li>Affiliated with Hecate Energy or any developer</li>
            <li>Paid activists or lobbyists</li>
            <li>Part of any political organization</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why We Built This Site</h2>

        <p>We watched misinformation spread through our community—scary-sounding claims about fires, farmland destruction, and watershed contamination. Claims that don't hold up to scrutiny.</p>

        <p>We saw neighbors repeating talking points from opposition groups without checking the facts. We saw fear winning over reason.</p>

        <p>So we did something about it.</p>

        <h2>How We're Funded</h2>

        <div class="card mt-8 mb-8">
          <h4>100% Out of Pocket</h4>
          <p>We paid for this website, the domain, SEO optimization, and marketing <strong>out of our own pockets</strong>.</p>
          <p>No solar company gave us money. No developer is behind this. Just regular people who got tired of misinformation.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Donations</strong> go toward:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Marketing and advertising to reach more people</li>
          <li>Community events and awareness campaigns</li>
          <li>Printing materials for public meetings</li>
          <li>Keeping this site running and updated</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="card mt-8 mb-4">
          <h4>Are you being paid by Hecate Energy?</h4>
          <p>No. We have no financial relationship with any solar developer. We're community members who support this project based on the facts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mb-4">
          <h4>Why do you support the Shepherd's Run project?</h4>
          <p>Because we've looked at the evidence. Solar is safe, reversible, good for farmers, and necessary for clean energy. The opposition arguments don't hold up to scrutiny.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mb-4">
          <h4>Why are you anonymous?</h4>
          <p>We've seen how opponents treat people who speak up. We have kids in local schools and businesses in the community. We shouldn't have to face harassment for supporting clean energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mb-4">
          <h4>How can I help?</h4>
          <p>Share this site. Attend public meetings. Speak up when you hear misinformation. And if you're able, <a href="support.html">donate</a> to help us reach more people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card mb-8">
          <h4>How do I contact you?</h4>
          <p>Use the <a href="support.html#contact">contact form</a> on our support page. We read every message.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>We're not special. We're not experts. We're just people who got frustrated enough to do something.</p>

        <p>If you're tired of fear-mongering and want facts, you're in the right place.</p>
