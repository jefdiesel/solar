# Columbia County Solar Facts

## Project Overview

Build a fact-check website countering misinformation from **Sensible Solar for Rural New York** (sensiblesolarny.org), a group opposing solar development in Columbia County, NY.

**Our position:** Pro-solar expansion in Columbia County. Not pro-Hecate, not anti-regulation. Solar is good for the county. Misinformation is bad. Let the permitting process work.

**What we support:**
- Solar development in Columbia County
- Legitimate regulatory oversight by ORES
- Compliance with fire safety and local requirements
- Honest public debate based on facts

**What we oppose:**
- Misinformation dressed up as environmentalism
- A small group of change-resistant residents claiming to speak for "rural New York"
- Using procedural delays to block clean energy indefinitely
- NIMBYism that keeps Columbia County dependent on imported fossil fuel electricity

## Target Audience

**Primary:** The newer Columbia County residents — weekenders, remote workers, estate owners, young families — who:
- Actually care about climate and clean energy
- Drive EVs or want charging infrastructure
- Would subscribe to community solar in a heartbeat
- Have been confused by SSRNY's fake environmental framing
- Don't realize the opposition is just townies afraid of change

**These people are natural solar allies.** They're not against progress — they've just heard misleading claims from a small, loud group that wraps anti-change sentiment in green language.

**Secondary:** Journalists, policymakers, and ORES officials who need factual counter-arguments.

**The opposition:** Old-guard locals (median age 66) who've been there forever, resent newcomers, and oppose any change. They're using "environment" as a shield because "we don't like new things" doesn't play as well.

## Target Site to Counter

- **URL:** https://sensiblesolarny.org
- **Their position:** Opposition to a 42MW / 215-acre solar project in Copake, Columbia County, NY
- **Their framing:** "Environmental" concerns about watershed, farmland, fire risk, schools

## Core Arguments to Make

### 1. The Fire Risk Lie

SSRNY cites an October 2024 fire at White River Solar Farm in Castleton as evidence of solar fire danger.

**The facts:**
- It was a **brush/grass fire**, not a panel fire
- Caused by dry conditions and high winds (Red Flag Warning day)
- The day after, Pure Sky Energy confirmed **"no obvious damage"** to any of the 17,000+ panels
- Castleton Fire Department called it a "brush fire" in their official report
- Fire burned in a ravine filled with debris, not the solar installation itself

**Sources:**
- WNYT follow-up: "Solar farm says 'no obvious damage' following large brush fire" (Oct 28, 2024)
- NEWS10: "Crews extinguish brush fires at Castleton solar farm" - fire department called it brush fire

### 2. The Farmland Reality

SSRNY claims to protect "prime agricultural land."

**The facts:**
- NY lost 14% of farms and 9% of farmland between 2012-2022
- Solar accounts for only **0.5%** of farmland loss statewide
- Agriculture in Columbia County is in structural decline — aging farmers, no successors
- Farmers lease to solar because it provides stable income that farming can't match
- Solar keeps land in agricultural zoning and **preserves it for future farming**
- Solar is **reversible** — pull up the poles in 30 years, land is intact
- The alternative? Land sits fallow, farms fail, rural economy declines

**The real story:** Solar gives farmers a viable path to keep their land instead of selling it off. It's not a threat to agriculture — it's a lifeline.

**Sources:**
- NY State Comptroller Agriculture Report (Nov 2024)
- NY Farm Bureau: "steepest decline in the past three decades"

### 3. The Watershed Argument Backfires

SSRNY claims the project threatens Hudson's drinking water via the Taghkanic Creek watershed.

**The facts:**
- If it's watershed land, it **can't be developed for housing anyway**
- Solar has **minimal ground disturbance** — poles driven into soil, no foundations
- Ground stays vegetated (often native grasses/pollinator habitat)
- **Zero** septic systems, fertilizer, pesticides, road salt, or impervious surfaces

**Compare to alternatives:**
| Land Use | Impervious Surface | Contamination Risk |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Solar farm | Minimal (poles, access roads) | **Low** |
| Residential | High (foundations, driveways, septic) | **High** |
| Active agriculture | Moderate | Moderate-High (fertilizer, pesticide runoff) |

**The logical conclusion:** Solar is one of the **best** uses for watershed land.

### 4. Columbia County Deserves Local Clean Energy

Columbia County residents care about clean energy — but right now they can't get it locally.

**The facts:**
- Hudson and Chatham have **zero** electricity generation facilities
- Columbia County imports nearly all power from the grid
- NY grid is **48.7% natural gas** (2024)
- Rural homes depend on **heating oil and propane** delivered by truck
- Community solar would let residents subscribe to local clean power
- Shepherd's Run would generate enough for ~9,500 homes

**The opportunity SSRNY is blocking:**
- Local clean energy generation
- Community solar subscriptions (typically 10% savings)
- Reduced dependence on fossil fuel deliveries
- Grid resilience during outages
- Clean energy jobs in the county

**The question:** Why should Columbia County keep importing gas-fired electricity when it could generate clean power locally?

### 5. "Industrial Scale" Framing

SSRNY calls 42MW "massive industrial-scale."

**Context:**
- A single natural gas peaker plant: 100-500MW
- 42MW powers approximately 9,500 homes
- This is a **community-scale** project, not industrial
- "Industrial" is loaded language designed to trigger opposition

### 6. The 700 Acres vs 215 Acres Trick

SSRNY says it "sprawls over 700 acres."

**The facts:**
- Only **215 acres** will have panels (fenced area)
- The rest is setbacks, buffers, and undeveloped land
- These buffers are **required** for visual screening and environmental protection
- They're counting protected buffer zones as "sprawl"

### 7. Who Is SSRNY Really?

SSRNY presents itself as an environmental coalition. It's not.

- Registered as nonprofit October 2020 (DOS #5851443)
- Registered agent: Darin E. Johnson
- Contact: saratraberman@gmail.com (Sara Traberman, 66 years old)
- P.O. Box 305, Craryville, NY 12521

**The reality:** This is old-guard townies resistant to change, wrapping themselves in environmental language. They're not climate activists — they're using "watershed" and "farmland" as cover for general opposition to development and newcomers.

**The tell:** Real environmentalists don't oppose solar. The Sierra Club, NRDC, and every major environmental org supports utility-scale solar as essential to climate goals. SSRNY's "environmental" concerns evaporate under scrutiny — they're not proposing alternatives, just "not here."

**The pattern:** 
- Older, long-time residents
- Suspicious of change and outsiders
- Using procedural objections and delay tactics
- Claiming to speak for "rural New York" while representing a handful of neighbors

This is change resistance dressed up as environmentalism.

## On Hecate Energy

**This site is pro-solar, not pro-Hecate.** We're not their PR firm.

### The Facts

Hecate is a real company with a real track record:
- Founded 2012, Chicago-based, MIT-educated leadership
- 4.1 GW of projects successfully developed across 17 states
- Just broke ground on NY's largest solar farm (500MW Cider Solar in Genesee County)
- Top-5 US solar developer by pipeline

But they also have issues:
- Messy corporate divorce with former investor Repsol (Spanish oil company)
- August 2025: Creditors sued claiming $82M loan default
- Second creditor joined the lawsuit
- Hecate denies the claims, litigation ongoing

### Our Position

**SSRNY's legitimate concerns:**
- Hecate should comply with all town and fire safety regulations
- The evacuation plan question for Taconic Hills Schools deserves a real answer
- Financial stability matters for long-term project commitments
- ORES should do its job and enforce permit conditions

**What we reject:**
- Using Hecate's corporate issues to oppose *all* solar development
- Pretending "fire risk" and "watershed" concerns are anything but cover
- A small group of change-resistant townies speaking for "rural New York"
- Fake environmentalism that opposes the cleanest energy source available

### The Bottom Line

If Hecate can't meet the requirements, another developer can build solar in Columbia County. The issue isn't Hecate — it's whether Columbia County will join the clean energy future or keep importing gas-fired electricity while burning heating oil.

**Solar expansion in Columbia County is good.** 

Whether Hecate specifically is the right developer is a separate question that ORES and the permitting process should answer. We're not here to defend a corporation — we're here to counter misinformation about solar energy.

## Notes for Claude Code

This is a counter-narrative/fact-check site. The goal is not to be inflammatory but to be **more credible** than the opposition. Every claim should be sourced. The design should feel professional and trustworthy — like journalism, not activism.

Priority order:
1. Get the facts right and sourced
2. Make it scannable (people won't read walls of text)
3. Make it shareable (good meta tags, social cards)
4. Make it findable (SEO for relevant searches)

The user may want to inscribe this on-chain eventually (they work with Ethscriptions/Base), so keep the build simple and the output portable.
